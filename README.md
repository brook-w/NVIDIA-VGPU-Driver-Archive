## Download and Extract

Because of the Github Release 2GB size limit, for some larger files I had to upload them in splitted zip volumes,
So you need to download all `7z.00*` files to able to decompress.

```bash
sudo apt -y install p7zip-full
7z x driver_name.7z.001
```

## Older versions

Please feel free to open an issue if you need a driver older than 10.0. I will try to respond in time and provide you with assistance.

## Preview

To get you a rough idea of what each zip contains, here's the `tree` output of fully extracted 15.0 version.

## About Drivers

> Which driver version I should choose?

- Proxmox and most linux QEMU hypervisor: LINUX_KVM
- Windows and hyperV: Windwos
- ESXI (vSphere): vSphere

> Windows Driver

NVIDIA uses the same driver for both windows host and guest machines.

For example, if you search `527.41_grid_win10_win11_server2019_server2022_dch_64bit_international.exe` in [15.0](https://github.com/justin-himself/NV-VGPU-History-Driver/blob/master/preview.txt) branch, you will find multiple windows drivers scattered in different folders, and they are all same. 

So if you are on a windows host, want to use the card directly, or you are passing through the whole card to a windows virtual machine, just use any windows driver in the branch.
