This repository contains history versions of NVIDIA vGPU drivers.  
这个仓库包含了 NVIDIA vGPU 驱动的历史版本。

Every verision contains driver for all platforms. If you can't find what you are looking for, open an issue and I'll try to solve it.  
每个版本包含了所有平台的驱动. 如果你找不到你想要的驱动, 开一个 issue, 我会尽量尝试解决。

Here's a [tutorial](https://justin.education/proxmox-nvidia-tesla-p4-vgpu-for-free/) in Chinese featuring vGPU solution on a proxmox server with Tesla P4 card. Please don't open issues unrelated to vGPU drivers provided in this repository and consider seeking help in [vGPU unlock](https://github.com/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock)  
[这](https://justin.education/proxmox-nvidia-tesla-p4-vgpu-for-free/)是一个关于在 Proxmox 上使用 Tesla P4 的教程。本仓库只负责提供 vGPU 驱动，关于 vGPU unlock 的问题请移步 [vGPU unlock](https://github.com/DualCoder/vgpu_unlock)。

## Download and Extract

Because of the Github Release 2GB size limit, for some larger files I had to upload them in splitted zip volumes,
So you need to download all `7z.00*` files to able to decompress.

## Preview

To get you a rough idea of what each zip contains, here's the `tree` output of fully extracted 15.0 version.

## About Drivers

> Which driver version I should choose?

- Proxmox and most linux QEMU hypervisor: LINUX_KVM
- Windows and hyperV: Windwos
- ESXI (vSphere): vSphere

> Windows Driver

NVIDIA uses the same driver for both windows host and guest machines.

For example, if you search `527.41_grid_win10_win11_server2019_server2022_dch_64bit_international.exe` in [15.0](https://github.com/justin-himself/NV-VGPU-History-Driver/blob/master/preview.txt) branch, you will find multiple windows drivers scattered in different folders, and they are all same. 

So if you are on a windows host, want to use the card directly, or you are passing through the whole card to a windows virtual machine, just use any windows driver in the branch.
